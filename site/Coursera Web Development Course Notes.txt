Block level elements render on a new line
 - may contain inline or other block-level elements.
 - Roughly translate into Flow Content(HTML5 category)

Inline elements render on the same line.
 - may only contain other inline elements.
 - Roughly translate into Phrasing Content(HTML5 category) 
 
 
 HTML5 replaces these definitions with a more complex set of content categories
 However, this distinction remains practical because it aligns well with existing css rules.
 
 
#menu-tile {
  height: 250px;
  width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  position: relative;
  border: 2px solid black;
  
}
 
<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <a href="menu-categories.html"><div id="menu-tile"><span>Menu
    </span></div></a>
</div>

The "width: 100%;" in the style declaration is saying that we want the width of the div with id="menu-tile" 
and everything that it encompases to be 100% of the width of the container that encompases the div with id="menu-tile" 
which in this case is <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
